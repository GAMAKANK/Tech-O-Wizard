<h3>Problem on which we are working- </h3>
So, nowadays we can see many cases of women harassment happening in our society which are really shocking and heartbreaking for us. Mostly women harassment occurs at the places having less or no people. 
These cases are more likely to occur when women travel from one place to another at late night or early morning. Obviously there are solutions like police patrolling but they are not present everywhere and even cctv cameras are not reviewed everyday, we see them when a event has been already occurred or they are active  at the time of  emergency.
Hence, we are coming with a solution to women security in this project to reduce this problem by implementing our technology by using streetlights which are present everywhere and are active also at the time of late night and early morning .<br>
<h3>Solution according to us-</h3>
<ol>
<li>In this project we are going to install <b>sound detector using Tensor Flow , a camera and a Styron</b> at these secluded places, and at night mostly all the places are secluded so <b> we will install our technology in the street lights as they are  present everywhere and unreachable to the punks</b> so that they canâ€™t destroy it.<br></li>

<li>In this technology , we will detect sounds  near these streetlights. We will use <b> python libraries to detect frequency of sound  near streetlight </b>. <b>We will set range of female voice frequency</b>.</li>li>

<li>If voice near streetlight lie in this range,we will send alert message to police and will start live video streaming of the area near the streetlight</li>

<li>Police will see if the girl is looking safe or not.</li>

<li>If something miscellaneous seem to happen then police can  start Styron and will make people living nearby  alert so that if police does not reach on time atleast people living nearby can help the girl there or even the patrolling police can reach them out.</li>
</ol>
